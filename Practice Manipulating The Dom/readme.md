# Practice Manipulating the DOM

https://coursework-projects.now.sh/

This exercise is a follow up to the making changes to the DOM stage of our JavaScript and the DOM course. 

In JavaScript, once you've selected an element, you can manipulate it in many different ways. In this challenge I created a small webpage and used only JavaScript to select and manipuate DOM elements like:

* HTML
* Text
* Attributes
* CSS Styles
* Creating Elements
* Appending & Removing DOM Nodes

The page has several elements that I manipulated with JavaScript only. No HTML or CSS was added to this page.
